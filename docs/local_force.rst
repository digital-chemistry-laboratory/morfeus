=====================
Local force constants
=====================

Local force constants can be calculated with the local modes method [1]_ or
the compliance matrix method [2]_. morfeus can use the output of Gaussian_,
xtb_, or UniMoVib_ programs.

***************
Preparing input
***************

The LocalForce class needs input from quantum-chemical frequency calculations.
Therefore, the instructions are a bit more involved. This input can be read
using the ``load_file`` method, and morfeus can also calculate some
quantities using its built-in normal mode analysis and internal coordinate
codes.

###########
Local modes
###########

The local modes approach needs the normal modes in internalcoordinates, here
called *internal modes*, as well as the normal mode force constants. The
internal modes can either be read from file or calculated with morfeus.
Specifically, the internal modes can be computed from the normal modes and the
Wilson B matrix. For local frequencies, additional input is needed.

  Input needed for the local modes approach.

#################
Compliance matrix
#################

The compliance matrix method needs the Hessian matrix and the Wilson B matrix.
For local frequencies, the elements are also needed (for their atomic masses).

#################
Recommended input
#################

The table below summarizes the recommended input to morfeus from the
supported programs. More details are given below.

########
Gaussian
########

Gaussian can provide the complete input for both the local modes and the
compliance matrix methods. The *log* file is recommended as input for the the
local modes method, and the *fchk* file for the compliance matrix method.
The Gaussian input file should be prepared with the following keywords
included (appropriate method and basis set need to be added as well).

==== =========================================
log  ``freq=intmodes iop(7/75=1) iop(1/33=3)``
fchk ``freq=intmodes``
==== =========================================

``iop(7/75=1)`` makes triggers printing of the internal modes with full
accuracy, while ``iop(1/33=3)`` triggers printing of the Wilson B matrix. The
table below lists all the quantities read by each approach.

  Force constants       x   x
  ==================== === ===

.. note:: 

  Additional accuracy for local modes calculations be achieved by loading
  also the fchk file which contains the normal mode force constants to
  higher accuracy.

########
UniMoVib
########

The UniMoVib program can do vibrational analysis for a range of different
quantum-chemical programs. The user needs to define internal coordinates in
addition to the information that can be read from the files. For the local
modes method, the *log* file is recommended. For the compliance matrix method,
either the *umv* or the *local* files are recommended.

  ==================== ===== === === 

The *log* file is the standard output of the program. The *umw* file and the
*local* file can be generated by specifying them in the input file:

  $end

  $qcdata
    fchk="freq.fchk"
  $end

###
xtb
###

The xtb program can provide the Hessian as well as the normal modes and normal
mode force constants. The files *hessian* and *xtb_normalmodes* are generated
by the xtb program as a results of a frequency calculation. The recommended
approach for both the local modes method and the compliance method matrix is
to use the *hessian* file.

  ==================== ======= =========== 

.. warning::

  xtb 6.2 has a bug which gives the wrong number of normal modes for linear
  molecules in the *xtb_normalmodes* file. Therefore, the approach of reading
  the Hessian and doing a normal mode analysis with morfeus is recommended.  

######################
Geometry optimizations
######################

Local force constants and frequencies are based on the harmonic approximation
that is valid only at stationary points (minima and transition states) on the
potential energy surface. Therefore, the geometry optimizations need to be of
good quality. For difficult examples on flat surfaces, this can mean
increasing the convergence criteria of the quantum-chemical program.
Vibrations with small imaginary frequencies should be eliminated as much as
possible. The local modes method with standards settings is somewhat robust to
the presence of these vibrations , while they can result in artifacts with the
compliance matrix method. Therefore, the local modes method is recommended in
these cases.

For transition states, the imaginary mode corresponding to the reaction is
projected out with the local modes approach. This also means that forces
involving the atoms corresponding this imaginary mode are meaningless and
should not be used. Only the local modes method can be used for transition
states.

.. warning::

  Transition states can only be treated with the local modes method. Force
  constants and frequencies of the atoms corresponding to the imaginary mode
  should not be used.

For the local modes method, projection of imaginary frequencies can be
controlled with the ``project_imag=<bool>`` keyword to the ``compute_local``
method. The cutoff for low-freqency modes can be controlled with 
``cutoff=<float>``. Internal coordinates can be added with the
``add_internal_coordinate`` method.

**********
Background
**********

Local force constants describe the bond strength based on vibrational
frequencies. There are two approachces in the literature: the local modes
method of Cremer [1]_ and the compliance matrix method of Grunenberg.[2]_
They have been shown to be equivalent within numerical accuracy.[3]_
morfeus can use either method, and they give almost identical results except
when there are modes with imaginary or very small frequencies. In these cases,
the local modes approach can handle the issue with  two methods: (1)
projecting out imaginary modes, and (2) raising the force constants of
low-frequency modes to a cutoff value. morfeus does this projection by
default and uses a cutoff of 0.001 mDyne/Å for low-frequency modes. We
therefore recommend local modes with default settings as the most robust
method in cases problematic cases. Expert users can turn off the projection
and alter the cutoff value.

Note that interactions involving imaginary modes (such as breaking/forming
bonds in transition states) cannot be assessed by the local force constants.

morfeus has been benchmarked against the local force constants and
frequencies given by Cremer [3]_ for small organic molecules.
