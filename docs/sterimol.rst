The Sterimol parameters L, B\ :sub:`1` and B\ :sub:`5` as described by Verloop
:footcite:`verloop_development_1976,verloop_sterimol_1983` are implemented.
Note that Sterimol parameters should be calculated with H as the dummy atom, to
be consistent with values in the literature (see `Background`_)

The Sterimol class calculates and stores Sterimol parameters.

.. code-block:: python
  :caption: Example
  
  >>> from morfeus import Sterimol, read_xyz
  >>> elements, coordinates = read_xyz("tBu.xyz")
  >>> sterimol = Sterimol(elements, coordinates, 1, 2)
  >>> sterimol.L_value
  4.209831193078874
  >>> sterimol.B_1_value
  2.8650676183152837
  >>> sterimol.B_5_value
  3.26903261263369
  >>> sterimol.print_report()
  L         B_1       B_5
  4.21      2.87      3.27

Radii can be changed with the argument ``radii_type=<str>`` and custom radii
can be supplied as a list with ``radii=<list>``. 

The bond length between atoms 1 and 2 and the uncorrected L values (without the
historical addition of 0.40 Å) can also be obtained.

.. code-block:: python
  :caption: Uncorrected L values

  >>> sterimol.L_value_uncorrected
  3.8098311930788737
  >>> sterimol.bond_length
  1.1
  >>> sterimol.print_report(verbose=True)
  L         B_1       B_5       L_uncorr  d(a1-a2)

The Sterimol vectors can be "buried":

  .. code-block:: python
 
    >>> elements, coordinates = read_xyz("P_p-Tol_3.xyz")
    >>> sterimol = Sterimol(elements, coordinates, 1, 2)
    >>> sterimol.print_report()

.. tab:: Truncate

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> sterimol.bury(method="truncate")
    >>> sterimol.print_report()
    L         B_1       B_5       
    5.90      4.27      5.01  
    
.. tab:: Slice

  .. code-block:: python
 
    >>> elements, coordinates = read_xyz("P_p-Tol_3.xyz")
    >>> sterimol = Sterimol(elements, coordinates, 1, 2)
    >>> sterimol.print_report()
    L         B_1       B_5       
    7.44      4.94      7.44      
    >>> sterimol.bury(method="slice")
    >>> sterimol.print_report()
    L         B_1       B_5       
    5.82      3.77      5.24    

There are three different methods for doing this:

``delete``
  Atoms outside the sphere + 0.5 vdW radius are deleted and the Sterimol
  vectors are calculated. This is the default.
``truncate``
  Sterimol vectors are calculated as usual, but truncated in length by the
  sphere.
``slice``
  A point vdW surface is constructed from the atoms and all points outside the
  sphere are removed. Then the Sterimol vectors are computed based on the 
  remaining points.

A standard sphere radius of 5.5 Å is used that can be changed with
``sphere_radius=<float>``. For the ``delete`` method, the scaling factor for the
atom cutoff can be changed with ``radii_scale=<float>``. For more information,
see the API: :py:meth:`Sterimol.bury <morfeus.sterimol.Sterimol.bury>`

The command line script gives access to the basic functionality from the
terminal.

  $ morfeus sterimol tBu.xyz - 1 2 - print_report

**********
Background
**********

The Sterimol parameters were developed by Verloop to describe the steric size
of substituents. The atom attached to the substituent in the calculation (by
definition H) is called atom 1 and the first atom in the substituent is called
atom 2. L can be described as the depth of the substituent. It is defined as
the length of the vector going from atom 1, through atom 2 and ending on the
tangent of the vdW surface. For historical reasons, L is corrected by adding
0.40 Å to this length. This  was due to a shift from using C(sp\ :sup:`2`) to H
as dummy atom.

B\ :sub:`1` and B\ :sub:`5` can be described as the minimum and maximum
rotational size of the substituent. They are defined as the shortest and
longest vectors from atom 2 to a tangent plane of the vdW surface which are
perpendicular to the L vector, respectively.

ᴍᴏʀғᴇᴜs has been benchmarked against Paton's Sterimol__ package. Using exactly
the same radii (Paton's modified Bondi), almost identical results are obtained.
(Note that ᴍᴏʀғᴇᴜs normally uses 1.20 Å as the Bondi vdW radius for H).ᴍᴏʀғᴇᴜs
calculates the B\ :sub:`1` and B\ :sub:`5` parameters by a different approach
from the original code. First, atomic spheres are created with a certain
density of points. B\ :sub:`1` and B\ :sub:`5` are then obtained by projection
of atoms onto vectors spanning the whole 360 degrees in the plane perpendicular
to L. B\ :sub:`5` is obtained from the largest projection, while B\ :sub:`1` is
obtained from the smallest maximum projection for the set of vectors.

Buried Sterimol was developed by Tobias Gensch while working in the group of
Matthew Sigman at the University of Utah [ref to come]. It is intended to limit
the Sterimol vectors to a volume of interest in the philosophy of the buried
volume. The original implementation uses the ``delete`` algorithm.
